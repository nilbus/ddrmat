DDR Mat Module for Parallel Ports
---------------------------------
This module allows you to use parallel port Playstation controller adapters
with your DDR mat. It is based off of gamecon.c included with the Linux
kernel, but tweaked for DDR mats. Note that this *only* for parallel adapters;
USB is supported via the standard USB joystick drivers. One example of
such an adapter is the standard one from http://www.buynshop.com.

In addition to this driver, you will need the hid, joydev, and input modules.
You may also need to link /dev/js0 to /dev/input/js0.

This module is *not* approved by any main kernel developers. It may make
your joystick fail. That being said, it does seem to work for many
people.

Compiling & Installing, Linux 2.6
---------------------------------
The compilation procedure under kernel 2.6 is
  # make -C <path to kernel source> SUBDIRS=$PWD modules

The path given to make must point to a functional source tree used to compile
the running kernel.  See <http://lwn.net/Articles/21823/> for a detailed
explanation.

To insert the module,
  # insmod ./ddrmat.ko gc=0,7

Finish installing the module by copying it to the appropriate directory and
running `depmod -ae`.  [This whole section could be simplified by rewriting
the makefile.]

Compiling & Installing, Linux 2.4
---------------------------------
To compile the module, run `make -f Makefile.old'. You will need to have the
kernel source properly linked under /lib/modules (this should be done
automatically when you first compile the kernel).

If you want to test it before you install it, you can
  # insmod ./ddrmat.o gc=0,7
as root after you compile it, and try running a program that uses the
joystick devices.

To install it, run `make install'.

Once installed, you can insert it via `modprobe ddrmat gc=0,7` or any of
the standard module mechanisms. A sample /etc/modules.conf entry might
look like:

options ddrmat gc=0,7
pre-install ddrmat modprobe parport_pc && modprobe joydev

It Doesn't Work!
----------------
0. This module is *not* for USB mats, only parallel ones.

1. Make sure you have the parport, joydev, input, and hid modules loaded,
   as well as the ddrmat module.

2. Are you passing in gc=0,7 as an argument? Do so.

3. If you're using lp.o (parallel printer support), disable it, and turn off
   anything that might use it, like a printing daemon. Then try reinserting
   the ddrmat module.

4. Make sure /dev/js0 is linked to /dev/input/js0, and your user has read
   permission to /dev/input/js0 (`chmod 444 /dev/input/js0').

5. Are you running DevFS? Don't. (Especially in 2.6.)

6. Is your parallel port turned on in your BIOS? Many times (especially
   on laptops) it is off by default, or because you forgot.

If it still doesn't work, drop by #pyddr on irc.freenode.net, or email
pyddr-discuss@icculus.org.

Many thanks to Vojtech for his help and guidance in hacking around with
his gamecon module!

Tom Grimes, for porting this driver to Linux 2.6.
